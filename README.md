# Moore-Hodgson-algorithm
An algorithm computing a minimal number of delayed tasks as a result of schedulling process on sequential processor. 

Every task is indivisible and independent of each other.



Time complexity: O(n*log(n)), where n - number of tasks. 

Space complexity: O(n), where n - number of tasks.
